PRODIGY_ML_01 Develop a linear regression model to forecast house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

Description: In this project, I have developed a Machine Learning Linear Regression model. I analyzed a house price prediction dataset to determine house prices based on various parameters. The process includes conducting Exploratory Data Analysis, splitting the data into training and testing sets, evaluating the model, and making predictions.

House price prediction involves utilizing data to estimate the value of a house. This can serve several purposes, including determining the sale price of a home, assessing mortgage risks, or making investment decisions. There are several methods for predicting house prices. Common approaches include:

Linear regression: A straightforward method that uses a linear relationship to predict house prices. The accuracy of these models can vary based on the quality of the data and the method applied. Nonetheless, these models are valuable tools for making informed decisions within the housing market.
